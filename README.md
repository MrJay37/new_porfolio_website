# New Portfolio Website Project!

Older project was made using the following:
* create-react-app (project guide for React apps)
* Sass (simply awesome styling sheet)
* JSS (JavaScript and CSS combined)
* react-icons (Icon library)
* Material UI components

New project uses
* NextJS (project guide framework built over React)
* Sass (simply awesome styling sheet)
* react-icons (Icon library)
* react-chartjs (chart components library)

List of upcoming features
* Release as a template to allow other users to fill data in
* Dynamic data population (currently, assets are part of the repository, I'm too lazy to build and host an API OR look for free alternatives for this, sorry, but one day!)
* Following up on the above point, once the assets are available through HTTP calls, static building to avoid calling resources on every fetch (NextJS provides a feature called staticProps, really useful)
* Contact form configuration (send messages to your backend service from the contact form on the webpage)
* Dynamic pages for creating a blog-style website
