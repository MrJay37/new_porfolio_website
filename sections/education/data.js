            Stevens was by far the most constructive educational experience I've had. I thought I was technically focused before but later on, I 
            was introduced to some of the smartest and brightest minds I've ever seen. Through the course of my study, I worked on topics varying 
            from embedded systems to cloud architectural design and it was baffling, how little I actually knew about technology. During this time, 
            my team and I won 2nd place at a Hackathon with several awards in other categories, got my first paid corporate internship, worked on 
            robot operating system (ROS) projects and a robotic arm, took a private class with Carlos Alomar, David Bowie's guitarist and worked overseas 
            with my team of musicians in India.

            After the all rounded experience in all parts of life, I chose a field of specialization and it was (surpise, surprise) electronics 
            engineering. The four years I spent here were life changing, my personality went from a vibrant social presence to a rather technically
            focused subject matter enthusiast. College was not only about technology, I accelerated learning in music, videography and editing, 
            high level understanding of various creative outlets such as story writing, graphic design, social media analysis, etc. Amongst all this,
            also made some of the closest friends that I'm still in touch with, along with some of the most pleasant memories ever. Oh, I started 
            my company also during this time (Abagauss)

            Mithibai was the "tributary meets the ocean" phase of my life. During the two years of high school, I was travelling one hour one way
            to reach school, attending 3 hour coaching on school days and 6 hour coaching on non school days, staying on campus late nights for the
            college festival arrangements and hanging out and exploring the city otherwise. I became fluent in double variable integration and derivation 
            and making beats and rapping during these two years. Did I mention that I also had jaundice (icterus) during this period?

            My parents had to send me to school and they chose this one. I like to call this place my core memory factory, so many important 
            life events came from this place. In the early years of your life, through experiences and guidances, you decide to pursue some 
            things. My foundation of performing arts and story writing came from here, along with all of my logical skills and 
            analytical intelligence. But oh boy, the environment of competition in this place...
